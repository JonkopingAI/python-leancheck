# This collects and tests all properties:
leancheck.main(verbose=True, exit_on_failure=False)
# Normal users should just call leancheck.main()
# We set exit_on_failure=False here because we have
# an intentionally incorrect property.
# The verbose is there so we get info on correct properties as well.
