import leancheck

# Properties about the functional "sorted()" interface

# Sorting once is the same as sorting twice
def prop_sorted_twice(xs: list[int]) -> bool:
    return sorted(sorted(xs)) == sorted(xs)

# After sorting, the list should retain all elements in the original list.
def prop_sorted_elem(x: int, xs: list[int]) -> bool:
    return (x in sorted(xs)) == (x in xs)

# After sorting, the list should not change its length
def prop_sorted_len(xs: list[int]) -> bool:
    return len(sorted(xs)) == len(xs)


# Properties about the imperative ".sort()" interface

# Sorting once is the same as sorting twice.
def prop_sort_twice(xs: list[int]) -> bool:
    xs.sort()
    ys = list(xs)
    xs.sort()
    return xs == ys

# After sorting, the list should retain all elements in the original list.
def prop_sort_elem(x: int, xs: list[int]) -> bool:
    ys = list(xs)
    ys.sort
    return (x in ys) == (x in xs)

# After sorting, the list should not change its length
def prop_sort_len(xs: list[int]) -> bool:
    ys = list(xs)
    ys.sort
    return len(ys) == len(xs)

# We could check the properties explicitly like so:
# check(prop_sorted_twice)
# check(prop_sorted_len)
# check(prop_sort_twice)
# check(prop_sort_elem)

# ... but we instead call leancheck.main()
# which tests all functions starting with prop_
leancheck.main(verbose=True)
